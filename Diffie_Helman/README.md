# **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Implementation**

This project demonstrates the **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm**, a fundamental cryptographic protocol used for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel. The code provided allows two users (Alice and Bob) to securely compute a shared secret key using modular arithmetic and discrete logarithms.

---

## **How It Works**
The Diffie-Hellman algorithm involves the following steps:

### **Step 1: Input Values**
The program prompts the user to provide the following inputs:

- **`q`** â€” A **prime number** (a crucial parameter for the modular arithmetic).  
- **`a`** â€” A **primitive root** of the prime number `q` (used to generate public keys).  
- **`Xa`** â€” The **private key** for User A (kept secret).  
- **`Xb`** â€” The **private key** for User B (kept secret).

> Example Input:  
```
Enter a prime number: 23
Enter a primitive root: 5
Enter the private key of A: 6
Enter the private key of B: 15
```

---

### **Step 2: Calculating Public Keys**
Using the given values, the program computes the **public keys** for both users using the formula:

\[
Y = a^{X} \mod q
\]

Where:
- `Y` = Public Key
- `a` = Primitive Root
- `X` = Private Key
- `q` = Prime Number

**Code Snippet:**
```python
Ya = math.pow(a, Xa) % q
Yb = math.pow(a, Xb) % q
print("Public key of A : ", Ya)
print("Public key of B : ", Yb)
```

> Example Output:  
```
Public key of A: 8.0
Public key of B: 19.0
```

---

### **Step 3: Calculating Shared Secret Keys**
Each user calculates the **shared secret key** using the other user's public key:

- For User A:  
\[
K_A = Y_b^{X_a} \mod q
\]

- For User B:  
\[
K_B = Y_a^{X_b} \mod q
\]

**Code Snippet:**
```python
Ka = math.pow(Yb, Xa) % q
Kb = math.pow(Ya, Xb) % q
print("Shared key for A : ", Ka)
print("Shared key for B : ", Kb)
```

> Example Output:  
```
Shared key for A: 2.0
Shared key for B: 2.0
```

âœ… The keys `Ka` and `Kb` must be **identical**, proving that both parties have successfully established a secure shared key.

---

### **Step 4: Understanding the Security**
- The **private keys** (`Xa` and `Xb`) are never shared publicly.
- The security of this algorithm relies on the **difficulty of computing discrete logarithms** in modular arithmetic.

## **Example Walkthrough**
### **Input**
```
Enter a prime number: 23
Enter a primitive root: 5
Enter the private key of A: 6
Enter the private key of B: 15
```

### **Output**
```
Public key of A: 8.0
Public key of B: 19.0
Shared key for A: 2.0
Shared key for B: 2.0
```

âœ… The shared keys match, meaning the key exchange is successful.

## **Key Concepts**
ðŸ”¹ **Prime Numbers** â€” Essential for ensuring secure modular arithmetic.  
ðŸ”¹ **Primitive Root** â€” A number that generates all the numbers in the prime field when raised to different powers.  
ðŸ”¹ **Public Keys** â€” Exchanged openly without compromising security.  
ðŸ”¹ **Private Keys** â€” Remain secret and are never shared.  
ðŸ”¹ **Shared Key** â€” The final agreed-upon key that both parties use for secure communication.

---

## **Potential Use Cases**
ðŸ”’ Secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSH, VPNs).  
ðŸ”’ Key exchange in messaging apps like WhatsApp or Signal.  
ðŸ”’ Secure cloud storage and file sharing.  

---

## **Improvements & Enhancements**
âœ… Add error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-prime `q`).  
âœ… Improve key validation to ensure `a` is a valid primitive root.  
âœ… Introduce larger prime values for enhanced security.  
âœ… Implement additional cryptographic functions for encryption after key exchange.
